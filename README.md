# Forum
Forum for people that want to create events and gatherings.

You can register as normal user and later be upgraded by administrator if you want to create your own events that are previously approved.
You can chat and start conversations with other users, leave comments and likes on events that you attended. 
Browse events and see their precise locations on the map, and ask the organizer any questions you may have.
